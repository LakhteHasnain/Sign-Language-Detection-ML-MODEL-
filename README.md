# Sign-Language-Detection-ML-MODEL-
This project involves the development of a robust sign language detection model utilizing ensemble learning technique alongside various individual classifiers.
The jupyter notebook contains the respective #comments(not so good) for better understanding.This model makes prediction on alphabet 'A','B','C'.
There is also code to capture images of hands to create dataset.
The Tutorial i followed was : https://youtu.be/MJCSjXepaAM?si=gt8vH-sye_T3XXfT
The model trainned in the video is not hyper tunned ,i hyper tunned it (as it was my project requirement) resulting in an over fitting case.
